Hello!

This is a placeholder article for this theme.

Here's a wonky way of doing clickable images, just because it took me ages to figure out:

[![The Metlink schedule of upcoming automated announcements][1]][1]

[2]: /img/railtalk/announcements.jpg (Click to see the full size image!)


### Update 1

You can have headings like any other markdown document.

Super smaller styles may not have styles in the CSS so you'll have to build them yourself

### Footer

You can easily change the footer icons in *_includes/footer.html*.

Even if you're not much of a web developer, it should be easy to copy the pattern.

For reference, check out the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) site.
